  - Cache the result of role lookups on the user object, as
    doing this lookup can be expensive.

0.005  2008-10-14
  - Make lookup_roles deal correctly with the call to
    $user_ob->$role_relation() returning either a list
    of roles, or a reference to a list of roles.

0.004  2008-10-06
  - Make sure classes specified in tangram_user_class
    and user_class are loaded when constructing.
  - Make role_name_field optional, for in the case where
    you have a method which returns a plain text list of
    roles, rather than a collection of Tangram objects.
  - Steal the user_results_filter idea from
    Catalyst::Authentication::Store::LDAP

0.003  2008-10-02
  - Make sure the user returned isa Catalyst::Authentication::User
    so that it's compatible with Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles
  - Add get_object to the user class to get the tangram object back.
  - Add AUTOLOAD delegation, so methods not found on the user object
    will be delegated to the Tangram object it proxies.
  - Overload stringification on the user object, stringifying to the
    tangram ID
  - Add roles compatibility / configuration settings + test
  - Fix reporting of supported features
  - Add POD spelling, strictness and warnings test
